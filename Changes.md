## Updates and changes

I did many changes since my last assignment failed. I continuously improved the names of the variables and functions to improve understandability. I cannot list all of these. However, in the list below I'll list bigger changes made since the last submission:

 - [ ] Time is properly displayed with hours and minutes
**calculateDateAndTime** in **TimeModel** now displays the time with the hh:mm format.
 - [ ] All functions are now withing a class
E.g the **TimeModel** is now in its own class.
